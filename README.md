# LIRI
Homework assignment for module #10 (U.T. Coding Bootcamp)

## Motivation
I created this program to gain experience in writing a command line node app. 

### How to Use
This app takes in certain parameters using the command line and gives you, the user, relevant data. 

Type node liri.js **concert-this** (whatever artist/band name you like) in the command line, and you will receive: 
* Name of the venue
* Venue location
* Date of the Event 

Type node liri.js **spotify-this-song** (whatever song you like) in the command line,
and you will receive:
* Artist(s)
* The song's name
* A preview link of the song from Spotify
* The album that the song is from

Type node liri.js **movie-this** (whatever movie you like) in the command line,
and you will receive:
* Title of the movie
* Year the movie came out
* IMDB Rating of the movie
* Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie
* Country where the movie was produced
* Language of the movie
* Plot of the movie
* Actors in the movie

Type node liri.js **do-what-it-says** in the command line,
and you will receive:
* The contents and functionality of whatever exists in random.txt

## Technology Used
* Node.js
* The use of the following APIs/libraries: Moment.js, OMDB API, Spotify API, Bands in Town API
